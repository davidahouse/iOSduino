# iOSduino - A collection of examples of connecting iOS devices to an Arduino.


## Light

This example uses a light sensitive resistor that is attached to an iPhone screen. A simple application adjusts the brightness of the area of the screen under the sensor and this is detected by the Arduino.


## MIDI

This example shows how an iPad application can act as a remote control for a Toy robot using the MIDI protocol.
